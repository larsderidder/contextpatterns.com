## Needs Investigation

Items flagged during copy review that require verification by an agent with web access or research capability.

### Factual Claims

1. **"65% fewer errors with architectural context (Microsoft)"** on the homepage stat bar. No source linked, no entry on the research page. Find the Microsoft study this refers to and verify the number. If it can't be sourced, replace the stat.

2. **Ankur Goyal quote** ("Good context engineering caches well. Bad context engineering is both slow and expensive.") on the research page has no source link. Find the original tweet, talk, or article.

3. **"Industry consensus, 2026"** entry on research page. The phrase "context failures, not model failures" is in quotes but unattributed. Find who originally said this, or remove the quotes and reframe as an observed trend.

4. **NoLiMa claim accuracy.** The homepage says "92% of models drop below 50% at 32k tokens." The Context Rot pattern page says "11 of 12 models." 11/12 = 91.7%, which rounds to 92%. Confirm whether NoLiMa tested 12 or 13 models (REFERENCES.md says 13 LLMs, which would make 11/13 = 85%, not 92%). Reconcile.

5. **Drew Breunig "85% capacity" claim.** The research page annotation for "How Contexts Fail" mentions "past 85% capacity" as a failure threshold. REFERENCES.md flags this as unsupported. Check whether Breunig's actual article states this number or if it was interpolated.

6. **Context-Bench model scores.** "Claude Sonnet 4.5 scored 74%, GPT-5 scored 72.67%." These will age. Decide whether to keep specific scores or generalize. Check if the scores are still current.

### Assets

7. **og-image.png** is referenced in Base.astro (`https://contextpatterns.com/og-image.png`). Verify the file exists in `public/` and renders correctly.

### Copy Nits — DONE

8. ~~Homepage stat label "Of models drop below 50% at 32k tokens" — reworded to "of models fall below 50% accuracy at 32k tokens".~~

9. ~~Context Lens description — trimmed "in real time" to reduce density.~~
